/* Task:
    ! Write a leap_year.cpp program that:
        * Takes a year as input.
        * Checks to see if the year is a four-digit number.
        * Displays whether or not the year falls on a leap year.

    ! There are 3 criteria that must be taken into account to identify a leap year:
        * If the year can be evenly divided by 4 then it is a leap year, howeverâ€¦
        * If that year can be evenly divided by 100, and it is not evenly divided by 400, then it is NOT a leap year.
        * If that year is evenly divisible by 400, then it is a leap year.
        *
        * // if y / 4 = 0                         -> leap year
        * // if y / 100 = 0 and y / 400 not=0     -> not leap year
        * // if y % 400 = 0                       -> leap year
